# Cover Your Arse (CYA) App

Welcome to the CYA App, because sometimes you need to document life's little "oopsies" before they become big "oh nos."

## Overview

This React-based app is your digital alibi generator, allowing users to meticulously log their interactions and filter them by rating and scenario. Perfect for those who like to keep receipts on... well, everything.

## Features

- **Log Creation**: Document your encounters before memory (or plausible deniability) fades.
- **Filtering**: Sort your interactions by rating (high, medium, low) or custom scenarios (e.g., "work," "home," "that one time at band camp").
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete logs. Because sometimes even your CYA needs a cover-up.
- **Detailed Entries**: Each log includes:
  - Title (keep it snappy)
  - Summary (for those who can't be bothered to read the whole thing)
  - Date (because time is a construct, but lawyers love specifics)
  - Rating (from "meh" to "oh snap!")
  - Scenario (tag it before you bag it)
  - Body (the juicy details)
  - Related People (name and shame, or protect the innocent)

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (because we like our types strong and our excuses stronger)
- **Backend** (coming soon): Node.js (why not add more JavaScript to the mix?)
- **API**: GraphQL 

## Installation

1. Clone the repo 
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start the app with `npm run start` (and start covering your... tracks)

## Usage

1. Create a new log entry every time you feel that tingling sensation of "I might need to remember this later."
2. Add all relevant details. Remember, it's not paranoia if they're really out to get you.
3. Use the filtering system to quickly find that one interaction that might save your bacon.

## Upcoming Features

Because apparently, we haven't made it easy enough to document your life's questionable decisions. Here's what's coming up on our "Make Excuses Great Again" roadmap:

1. **Review Dates**: Set reminders to revisit your past shenanigans. You know, in case you need to "refresh" your memory.

2. **Calendar View**: See your excuses laid out in a neat calendar format. Perfect for identifying those suspiciously frequent "sick days."

3. **Export Reports as Email**: For when you need to spam your boss with a 50-page PDF of "Why I'm Actually the Victim Here."

4. **Social Media Sharing**: Because if you didn't share your alibi, did it even happen? (Lawyers advise against this feature, but we're rebels.)

5. **Messaging Service Integration**: Spread your carefully crafted narratives faster than office gossip.

6. **OAuth Login**: 
   - Google
   - Facebook
   - Apple

Stay tuned for these groundbreaking additions that will blow up the way you justify your actions. Remember, it's not about the excuse you make, it's about the meticulous digital trail you leave behind!
